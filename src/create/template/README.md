# Tobikura with Jest

This template provides a minimal setup to get Tobikura working with Jest.
The setup also created example tests to demonstrate Tobikura's behavior.

Feel free to remove the `example` directory once you've familiarized yourself and start crafting your own tests.

# How to Run Example Tests
Follow these steps to run the example tests and observe Tobikura in action:

1. **Setup:** Execute `npm install` to set up the necessary dependencies.
2. **Start Server:** Navigate to the `example` directory and start the Dockerized server with `make start`.
3. **Open Website**: Check the server is running by opening http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
4. **Run Test:** In this directory, run the tests using `npm run test`. 
5. **Wait:** Allow the tests to run and complete.
6. **View Results:** Open `dist/reporter.html` to view test results.
7. **Stop Server:** After testing, stop the server by navigating to the `example` directory and using `make stop`.
